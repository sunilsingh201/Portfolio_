                questions increases the
                level of curiosity in me to watch more, read more, discuss more all about cosmos. Antimatter,
                darkmatter, solar system, galaxies, Neutron stars, constellation, black hole, worm hole, universe,
                multiuniverse, space, general relativity, space-time, dark energy, extraterrestrial object, gravity,
                big bang, string theory... I dont want anything but a person whom i can talk about only cosmos.

                Whatever may be I am doing I always play music. Yes its like a drug to me and I am addicted to
                music. If you
                ask about my favourite song, you suggest me a song and that will become my favourite. I play that
                song until someone suggest a new song.I utilize my free time playing Cricket, and most of the time
                sleeping. Along with I Love to watch the documentries especially if it is crime investigation,
                biopic... Ones in a week I pick stock and study its fundamentals. Accordinaly I put the stock in
                different category
